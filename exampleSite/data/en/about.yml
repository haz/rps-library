    The Rideau school library is sorely in need of updating. 
     - This past fall, the library lost half of its space to create a much-needed new flexible-use class area; the two spaces are separated by a curtain and the noise problem between the two spaces is intolerable.
     - The books and resources are old and out of date; a team of volunteers recently purged over 300 books that were inappropriate, completely outdated, or falling apart.
     - The bookshelves are small and damaged.
     - There is nowhere in the library for students to curl up with a good book.
     - Books for different age groups are not distinguished.
     - The carpet is threadbare and peeling and emits a bit of an odour; the space is not inviting.
     - There is no school librarian at the school anymore, even part-time, and the current reshelving system consists of Canadian Tire bins.   
     - The wall art is paper cutouts of book characters the students no longer care about.
